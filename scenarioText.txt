~.... wake up .... hey .... GET UP! 10~
~You open your eyes, well your eye. The other one is swollen shut. Your mind is groggy and you look around to get your bearings. You are in a small room in an unfamiliar ship… you see the one who woke you. He’s an android. He is also in pretty bad shape. 11~
~“Hey get over here. Give me a hand.” 12~
~Still disoriented you just give him a questioning look. 13~
~“Hurry up they’re gonna come back any time.” 14~
~You still just sort of sit there and cock your head. 15~
~He is clearly getting frustrated. “LISTEN DO YOU NOT GET IT? Some group of space pirates has us right now and we’re at Klagfar’s Arena, you know that gladiator colosseum full of prisoners that fight to the death. If you don’t get over her we WILL die.”16~
~It starts to come back to you. You remember your ship being docked and broken into. And then it gets fuzzy. You get up slowly and the room gets dizzy. You get yourself together and walk over to him. 17~
~“Look I had an internal galactic map hidden away here. See we’re right here docked just outside where Klagfar’s Arena is located. My main battery is drained. I assume they thought I only had one. My reserve only has enough power to last me about an hour so we have to work fast.” 18~
~His finger starts to blow fire like a mini blowtorch. He fiddles with the control panel. 19~
~“Here hold this button down now. I have to open the door while you keep that held in.” 20~
~You do as he says and he forces the door open. He slowly peeks out the door. 21~
~“Heads up we’ve got two guys out there to the left. Looks like we’re gonna have to go through them.” 22~
~“All right let’s do this.” The two of you run out, he tackles the first guard. You approach the second guard and prepare for a fight. 23~
~ You come out though not unscathed and press onward. If you go towards the bad guys you must be going in the right direction right? 24~
~You come upon what looks like a security room. Nobody is inside at the moment. Your newly found friend jumps straight into the action. 25~
~“I can definitely find a way out of here now.” 26~
~His finger extends into a long cord. He plugs himself into one of the computers. 27~
~“I can charge up my main battery and find a way out at the same time. I’m gonna look into where ships are docked in this place. There has to be one that nobody would notice went missing for a little while. Bingo. Alright guy looks like its gonna be time to part ways. I can’t hold your hand forever. Look here on the map this is where you need to go. Take the IS-742 docked on the north side. I’d go with you but I still need to do something before I shove off. 28~ 
~You hesitantly turn away as he still searches through computer files. You aren’t sure why this stranger has helped you so much but are nevertheless grateful. You head down to the loading dock hiding around corners to try avoid guards all the way. 29~
~You find the exact ship the metal man told you to and climb aboard. It's definitely seen some damage. It's an older model. You fire the thrusters and the ship rumbles violently. Definitely on its last legs.  30~
~As you approach the inner doors they open on their own. Is that how the building works or is your new friend still looking out for you? You decide it doesn't really matter. All that matters is making it home. 31~
~You make it out into the infinite vacuum of space. Looking back you can see the collosal arena in all its grandeur. Nobody seems to be following you. Unsure if the ship will actually get you all the way home you head off in search of the nearest repair terminal. 32~
~You approach a desert planet. There is sand and dirt blowing in the wind. You land just fine directly in the middle of a junkyard and wrap a cloth you found around your head to cover your mouth and nose from the sand. 33~
~You approach the small building marked with an "Open" sign on the door. You knock with three hard raps. 34~
~No response. 35~
~You raise your hand to knock a second time. Right before you make contact the door swings open and an older Glorgok looks up at you without saying a word. 36~
~Finally he utters "If you're just gonna stand there all day I'm gonna shut my door and be done with you." 37~
~You tell him about your ship and that you need a more accurate map to find home. 38~
~After inquiring and bargaining for the work you end up needing to do some work for him. He tells you he needs you to trek about 5 miles out to a small cave to gather some crystal shards from the cave cieling so he can use them to power his home. 39~
~You agreee to his terms and rewrap your scarf to star out on your journey. 40~
